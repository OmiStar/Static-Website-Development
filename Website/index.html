            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term
                "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means 'work'.According to the Merriam
                Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that
                the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey)
                and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil).
            </p><br>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">In English we still
                occasionally use the words "travail", which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester in his book
                The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words "travel" and "travail" both share an even more ancient root:
                a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale).
                This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Travel in modern times may or
                may not be much easier depending upon the destination. Travel to Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest,
                extreme tourism, and adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel. Travel can also be more
                difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by bus, cruise ship, or even by bullock cart.

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, however, it
                was important to the economy and to society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants
                dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the services of many
                itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues (Wandering Monks) and wandering friars
                brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, traveling minstrels practiced the never-ending
                tour, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars.Pilgrimages were
                common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of travelers both locally (Canterbury
                Tales-style) and internationally.Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than
                land-travel,at least until the advent of a network of railways in the 19th century.
            </p><br>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Travel for the purpose of
                tourism is reported to have started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was
                no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalized on by people like Thomas Cook selling
                tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together.Airships and airplanes took over much
                of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the Second World War
                where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots.Indeed, air travel has become so ubiquitous in
                the 21st century that one woman, Alexis Alford, visited all 196 countries before the age of 21.

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Authorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to ensure
                travel safety.When traveling abroad, the odds favor a safe and incident-free trip, however,
                travelers can be subject to difficulties, crime and violence.Some safety considerations include
                being aware of one's surroundings,avoiding being the target of a crime,leaving copies of one's
                passport and itinerary information with trusted people,obtaining medical insurance valid in the
                country being visited and registering with one's national embassy when arriving in a foreign
                country.Many countries do not recognize drivers' licenses from other countries; however most
                countries accept international driving permits.
            </p><br>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Automobile insurance policies issued in one's own
                country are often invalid in foreign countries, and it is often a requirement to obtain temporary auto
                insurance valid in the country being visited.It is also advisable to become oriented with the
                driving rules and -regulations of destination countries.Wearing a seat belt is highly advisable for
                safety reasons; many countries have penalties for violating seatbelt laws.</p>
